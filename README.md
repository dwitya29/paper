# Paper.id Take-Home Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

## Summary - Please read me

Hi, my name is Dwitya. I completed this test in approximately 4 hours (maybe more but not much) according to the instructions given in the take-home test document.

I completed the requirements given, but unfortunately, I didn't have time to do the following things because I ran out of time:

- Handling errors properly
- Unit test with various conditions (loading, error, etc.)
- Unit test coverage is still very little

Thank you for the opportunity to test that has been given, I really hope that the results of my work can meet the criteria to pass to the next stage, once again thank you very much!
